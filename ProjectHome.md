Keccak is a cryptographic hash function family, which is candidate as SHA-3.
The most common usages of a cryptographic hash function are:
  1. Integrity of files or messages verification
  1. File or data identification
  1. Pseudorandom generation and key derivation
The aim of this project is to develop a common base for those applications needing a massive usage of Keccak.
